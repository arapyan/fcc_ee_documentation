LEP3:

For sigmaHZ x H->bb at 240 GeV:
	Transverse momentum of lepton pair larger than 10 GeV
	Longitudinal momentum smaller than 50 GeV
	Acoplanarity - angle between lepton pair plane and beam axis - larger than 10 degrees
	
	Radiative return to the Z mass?
	
	Acollinearity - angle between two leptons, larger than 100 degrees
	
	Each event with more than two jets is forced to form two jets
	
	All jets must have at least five reconstructed particles
	At least one charged hadron
